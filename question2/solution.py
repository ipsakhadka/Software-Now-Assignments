Now, we will create a function to combine all csv files and create a dataframe
There is information about 20 different years in 20 separate csv files. We will merge all those csvs in a single dataframe.
We will use the glob module which makes it easy to find all the pathnames matching a specified pattern, in this case, .csv .
